# datathon-voter-registration
Code from Datathon NYU Fall 2021


Last semester, a close friend and I created a team for a datathon. The goal of this datathon was to make voter data more accessible and anonymous. After some group brainstorming, I thought of the idea of jittering the data to add random noise. The columns I chose were latitude and longitude so that each voter's location was not exactly specified, rather, a five mile radius was given. This increases anonymity of the voter's home address while still staying true to the accuracy of the data.
